# Leads-Management-Automation
The "Leads Organization" script is designed to automate the management of leads within a Google Sheets environment. Triggered by the `onEdit` function, it monitors edits in the "Settings" sheet's columns B (member names) and F (emails). When both fields are populated, it creates a new sheet named after the member if it doesn't already exist, copying a template named "Draft leads for deps." It inserts the member's name into the new sheet, protects specified ranges, and updates QUERY formulas across relevant sheets based on the member's name to streamline lead management and data organization. Additionally, changes to cell B5 in the "Settings" sheet also trigger an update to these QUERY formulas via the `updateQueryFormula` function.
